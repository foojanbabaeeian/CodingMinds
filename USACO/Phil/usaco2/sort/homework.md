# L8 Assessment - Sorting Algorithms
## Problem 1

What are some common sorting algorithms? Explain the pseudo code for one of them.

## Problem 2

What is the basic idea of merge sort/quick sort?

## Problem 3

What is the time complexity of merge sort/quick sort?

## Problem 4

If a program were to have a merge sort sorting function in it, such as the one below, what is the overall time complexity of the program?

```python
nums = [10, 9, 1, 10, 6, 0, 1, 1, 8, 5]

nums.sort()
for i in range(len(nums)):
    print(nums[i])
```
