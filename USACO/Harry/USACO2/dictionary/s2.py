Problem Statement
Given a list of integers nums and an integer target, write a function that finds the indices of the two integers that adds up to target.

\*\*Note that you may not use the same element twice, and assume the problem has exactly one solution.

Can you solve it in a linear time complexity O(n)? Hint: Use a dictionary instead of nested loops.

Example 1:


nums = [4, 7, 1, 6]
target = 10

# output:
# [0, 3]
# nums[0] + nums[3] = target = 10
print(twoSum(nums, target))
Example 2:


nums = [4, 8, 1, 6, 10]
target = 11

# output:
# [2, 4]
# nums[2] + nums[4] = target = 11
print(twoSum(nums, target))

'''
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

nums = []
for blah
    for boo
        hjdskdld

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 26
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
