P3-5 Exercise: Find Single Number
Problem Statement
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Can you solve it in a linear time complexity O(n)? Hint: Use a dictionary instead of nested loops.

Example 1:


nums = [2, 2, 1]

# output: 1
# number 1 has only appeared for one time.
print(singleNumber(nums))
Example 2:


nums = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 8, 4]

# output: 8
# number 8 has only appeared for one time.
print(singleNumber(nums))
