Leetcode: Contains Duplicates

Given a list of integers nums, check whether there are any values that appeared at least twice in the list.

Your solution has to have a linear time complexity O(n), and need to use the set data structure.

## Problem 5

Given a string, count how many unique characters appear in this string, and return the number.

Your solution has to have a linear time complexity O(n).

Example:

python
s = "happy"

# output: 4

# There are 4 unique characters in the word "happy"

print(uniqueChar(s))
