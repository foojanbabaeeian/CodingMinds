P3-3 Exercise: Count Unique Characters
Problem Statement
Given a string, count how many unique characters appear in this string, and return the number.

Can you solve it in a linear time complexity O(n)? Hint: Use a dictionary instead of nested loops.

Example 1:

python
word = "ssahua"

# output: 4
# The four unique characters are "s", "a", "h", "u"
print(countChar(word))
Example 2:

python
word = "kk"

# output: 1
# The unique character is "k"
print(countChar(word))
