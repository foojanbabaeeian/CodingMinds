Practice Question 15: Upper Quartile GPA
The upper quartile, or third quartile, is the value that separates the top 25% with the lower 75% in a dataset. Given a list of numbers representing every students' grade, find the upper quartile GPA in the class among all students.

Example:

python
gpa = [3.5, 2.5, 3.7, 3.14, 3.42]

# output: 3.5
print(upperQuartile(gpa))

Practice Question 16: Count Non Unique Numbers
Count how many numbers that has appeared two or more times in a given list.

Example 1:

python
nums = [8, 1, 10, 1, 2, 2, 8, 7, 10, 3]

# output: 4
# number 1, 2, 8, and 10 has appeared two or more times
print(countNonUnique(nums))
Example 2:

python
nums = [2, 5, 10, 7, 6, 2, 7, 5, 10, 2, 6, 10]

# output: 5
# number 2, 5, 6, 7, and 10 has appeared two or more times
print(countNonUnique(nums))
