Practice Question 12: Factorial of number N
A factorial is the product of all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1. Find the factorial of a given integer n. Assume the given integer n is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

Example:

python
# output: 24
# 4 factorial = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24
print(factorial(4))

# output: 5040
# 4 factorial = 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 5040
print(factorial(7))


Practice Question 13: Longest Word in a List

# output: ["chocolate"]
print(longestWord(words))


names = ["James", "Joy", "Rick", "John", "Kevin", "Jay"]

# output: ["James", "Kevin"]
